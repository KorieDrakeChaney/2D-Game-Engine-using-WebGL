/**
 * @class
 * @name Shader
 * @classdesc  A shader is a program that is responsible for rendering graphical primitives on a device's
 * graphics processor. The shader is generated from a shader definition. This shader definition specifies
 * the code for processing vertices and fragments processed by the GPU. The language of the code is GLSL
 * (or more specifically ESSL, the OpenGL ES Shading Language). The shader definition also describes how
 * the PlayCanvas engine should map vertex buffer elements onto the attributes specified in the vertex
 * shader code.
 * @description Creates a new shader object
